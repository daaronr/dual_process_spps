We are mainly interested in the effects of images of distressed people, and information about the effectiveness of a charity cause. We compare the impact of these different appeals on donations, as well as the order in which they might be presented.<\/p>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>How was this tested?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There were a number of versions of this survey, and you received one of them. Most participants were shown an image of an Ethiopian child, and\/or a text about rethinking numerical information in charitable giving (e.g., number of people who can be helped). Different survey versions varied in terms of when the image and the numerical information were presented: Some saw the image first, and others started with the numerical information. A third version only included the image, and a forth only included the numerical information. A final (control) version of the survey instead focused&nbsp; on general information about Ethiopia. All participants were subsequently asked about donating from a potential bonus payment, based on the outcome of a raffle. <br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>If you become a winner in the raffle, a donation equivalent to the amount specified here will be given to the Against Malaria Foundation and\/or Save the Children (depending on the type of program you chose), while you would receive any remainder of the $50 as a bonus.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nFinally we asked some questions the donation part of the study, as well as some demographics. As explained in the consent form, we also examined how carefully people respond by tracking the time it takes to complete the survey, as well as specific key questions. The response time information could also be used to examine if participants vary in terms of how fast they made decisions about donations.<br>\n&nbsp;\n<p><strong>Main questions:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>How do people respond to images and information about effectiveness when they decide to donate (or not) to charity? Does it matter in which order these things are presented?<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is this important to study?<\/strong><br>\n<br>\nThe results of this study are important for understanding when and why people are willing to give up resources for the benefit of someone else.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Further suggested reading:<\/strong><br>\n<br>\nSlovic, P.
