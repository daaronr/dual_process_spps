We are mainly interested in the effects of images of distressed people, and information about efficiency of a charity cause. We compare exposure to images and efficiency information (or both) to a control version with none of these components.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe remaining parts of the study focus on demographics and the question whether certain personality traits (e.g., empathy) are associated with different reactions to the image and the efficiency information.\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>How was this tested?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>There were six versions of this survey, of which you received one. The different surveys varied in terms exposure and timing of images and efficiency information. One sixth of all participants were randomized to view an image of a young boy in Syria, and asked to state their spontaneous reaction to it. Afterwards they were asked about their willingness to donate money to a charity organization working in Syria. Another random sixth was instead asked to review information about two charities with different levels of economic efficiency. They were asked the same questions about donations, as well as which of the two charities they preferred. A third random group of participants got the same comparison of more or less efficient charities, but they were asked about initial intentions to donate before they got to this information. A fourth and fifth group first got to see the image of the young boy, and then they received the efficiency comparison of two charities. These versions differed in terms of whether the efficiency comparison came before or after the intention question about donations (comparable to the difference between group two and three). Finally, the last group of participants came directly to the donation question, without seeing any image or any information about charity efficiency (control condition).<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Afterwards we asked all participants if they would be willing to donate part of their potential raffle winnings to a Syrian emergency relief fund. The willingness to donate represents the primary outcome of interest in this study. Donations equivalent to the amount specified here will be given to the Syria fund of Save the Children. Finally we asked a number of questions about personality and social attitudes. As explained in the consent form, we also examined how carefully people responded by tracking the time to complete the survey, as well as specific key questions. The response time information could also be used to examine if participants vary in terms of how fast they made decisions about donations.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Main questions:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>How do people respond to images and information about efficiency when they decide to donate (or not) to charity?<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Are differences in such behaviors related to peoples&rsquo; personality and social opinions?<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is this important to study?<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe results of this study are important for understanding when and why people are willing to give up resources for the benefit of someone else.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Further suggested reading:<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\nSlovic, P.
