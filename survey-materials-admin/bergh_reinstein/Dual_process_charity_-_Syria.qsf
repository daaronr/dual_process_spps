When a child is infected with wild poliovirus, the virus enters the body through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine. It is then shed into the environment through the faeces where it can spread rapidly through a community, especially in situations of poor hygiene and sanitation. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><br>\n<span style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">Young children who are not yet toilet-trained are a ready source of transmission, regardless of their environment. Polio can be spread when food or drink is contaminated by faeces. There is also evidence that flies can passively transfer poliovirus from faeces to food.<br>\n<br>\nEven symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can \u201csilently\u201d spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges.

We are mainly interested in the effects of images of distressed people, and information about efficiency of a charity cause. We compare exposure to images and efficiency information (or both) to a control version with none of these components. <br><\/p><p><br><\/p>The remaining parts of the study focus on demographics and the question whether certain personality traits (e.g., empathy) are associated with different reactions to the image and the efficiency information.\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>How was this tested?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>One quarter of the participants were randomized to view an image of a young boy in Syria, and asked to state their spontaneous reaction to it. Another random quarter was instead asked to review some information describing the efficiency of an emergency relief charity organization (the one subsequently used in our donation task). A third quarter got to first see the image and then the efficiency information. Finally, the last quarter of participants came directly to the donation question, without seeing any image or information about charity efficiency (control condition). <br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Afterwards we asked all participants if they would be willing to donate part of their bonus to a Syrian emergency relief fund. The willingness to donate represents the primary outcome of interest in this study. Donations equivalent to the amount specified here will be given to the Syria fund of Save the Children. Finally we asked a number of questions about personality and social attitudes.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Main questions:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>How do people respond to images and information about efficiency when they decide to donate (or not) to charity?<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Are differences in such behaviors related to peoples\u2019 personality and social opinions?<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is this important to study?<\/strong><br>\n<br>\nThe results of this study are important for understanding when and why people are willing to give up resources for the benefit of someone else.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Further suggested reading:<\/strong><br>\n<br>\nSlovic, P.
