# This repo covers Bergh and Reinstein "Empathic and Numerate Giving"; it is an extract/subset of another repo...

Extracted from https://github.com/daaronr/dualprocess, making it just to focus on this one paper.


Bergh/Reinstein experiments (5 lab and one field-ish), [published article 'Empathic and Numerate Giving: The Joint Effects of Victim Images and Charity Evaluation' in SPSS](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/39550). But this data can contribute to further analysis


This also ties in to the "Increasing effective charitable giving" project (see repo [here](https://github.com/daaronr/ea_giving_barriers))
especially [chapter 8 Barriers: Aversion/obstacles to doing (and using) evaluations](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/eval-aversion.html)
