%What determines *where* we give, and how impactfully? SPI/GFI lunch
%David Reinstein


<!---
Much research about charitable giving focuses on encouraging people to give (more) to charities. We have relatively limited understanding about how to encourage people to give to more effective charities. During this session we illustrate how the Giving for Impact Foundation stimulates research on getting more people to donate more to highly effective charities - and why. We will explain how we decide to fund projects. Moreover, we will indicate where we think the biggest knowledge gaps lay (both fundamental and applied research), and what low-hanging fruits are.

#Introduction: What determines 'where' we give?

##Framework

If we believe:

\bigskip

> People respond to asks, they don't say 'I want to give' and look for a target

\


. . .


\bigskip


Then the key issues are :

1. Exposure to asks

\pdfnote{What asks will people be exposed to?}

2. Crowding out

<!---
Does one ask (or donation) crowd out another, and if so when and how?
-->

3. Responses to an ask $\times$ charity mission, impact, effectiveness $\times$ presentation of this information (emotional, statistical,...)


\

\textcolor{blue}{Caveats: big and little guys}


\pdfnote{Larger philanthropists may indeed be searching for the 'optimal charity' \textCR
Little guys may also respond to a perceived need (e.g., news of an earthquake) and look for a charity}


#Broad facts

##

- International/effective giving amount, share of total

<!---
What share of giving (US, abroad) is international and/or effective?
- From small vs large/donors and foundations?
    - Church good works?
-->

- Who gives to these causes?

***

##USA

- 6\%, \$22 billion, about 0.1% of GDP, about \$75 per capita, to "International affairs" (Giving USA, 2016)
    - cf., Gates Foundation spends \$3-5 billion per year
    - \$30 billion ODA

. . .

Probably higher *shares* in other countries; international comparisons difficult

\pdfnote{e.g., 21\% in the NL; GINPS Wiepking 2005 data}

##Who gives to development?

- Similar to domestic givers, most international givers also give domestically

- Education, degrees a strong correlate in several studies

***

**UK survey microdata,** Micklewright and Sylke (2009):

- Overseas donors typically donate to many causes

- Donors/Domestic/Non: Very similar stated beliefs about activities that "contribute effectively to reducing poverty in developing countries"

- Income elasticities: Similar relationships for domestic/overseas donations, but in *controlled* regressions the income elasticity is lower for overseas


. . .


- Education degree-level:
    - + assoc to probability of caring about developing world poverty
    - + and to making a donation given that one cares about an area


. . .


**US GVUSA survey (2001):** Casale and Baumann (2013) international giving associated with postgraduate education, being foreign-born, religiosity institutional trust and youth volunteering

\pdfnote{Education also a major correlate in Austria: Srnka, Grohs, & Eckler, 2003}

#Q2. "Crowding out"

- Substitution: Does Peter rob Paul and if so, how much? Does he also rob Mary?
    - Effective to ask people to "choose effective charity *instead of* brand-X"?


. . .


- Homo Economicus: "Are these goods complements or substitutes" in the long/short run?
    - Economists beginning to model/measure giving to *multiple* charities; traditional WG/PG models uninformative


. . .


- Arguments: 'learned giving' versus competition

- Context may matter

\pdfnote{Should people take the EA "Pepsi challenge"?}

***

##Measuring Substitution: Conceptual and empirical challenges

**Theory**

- Standard framework: "Gifts to Cancer Research UK" and "Gifts to Against Malaria" (or to these *causes*) arise out of a joint optimization; one doesn't "respond" to the other

\pdfnote{Prices and external changes can shift each, but we cannot "force you to voluntarily give" in a meaningful way \textCR
If we *could* shift $\rightarrow$ apply theory of Conditional Demand (Pollak) $\rightarrow$ "expenditure substitution" \textCR
"Prices" unclear in this context, depends on model of benefits of giving, rarely vary exogenously}

***

Simpler question: Does a typical "promotion for CRUK" cause more or less giving to Malaria?

- But is the causality...

. . .


"CRUK promo" $\rightarrow$

. . .


"give more to CRUK"


. . .


$\rightarrow$ give less (more) to Oxfam

???



\pdfnote{Hard to rule out *direct* effects of promo, \textCR
"mediation analysis" is difficult, \textCR
And do we want to include or exclude the impact of "less money remains to spend"? Pollak: the 'money-income' effect}

\pdfnote{And one may want to disentangle substitution patterns at intensive and extensive margins \textCR
 A may be less in competition with B because "no one who gives to B ever cares about or is exposed to A"}

***

**Empirical**


\bigskip

To learn the 'whole truth' about crowding out, we want:

- Lifetime charitable giving data for a diverse representative population

- Specific and exogenous shocks relevant to one charity only, exemplifying a range of 'typical promotions' mapping out a broad swath of society

\bigskip

\pause

*Alternative approaches:*

- Look for and generate specific shocks, look for "local" effects, make assumptions to allow generalization

- Aggregate data on appeals and shocks, esp. natural disasters

\pause

\bigskip

**Growing evidence on substitution, but still no gold-standard evidence**

***

##Lab experiments

**Lab in-group dictator games and VCMs**

- Andreoni and Miller (2002): GARP/WARP, price sensitivity
- Krieg and Samek (2014): simultaneous PGG with two different groups, finds complementarity

<!---
- Fisman, Kariv, and Markovits (2005): Advances A\&M, estimates utility function, classifies by types
    - Substitution patterns in gifts to multiple other lab participants and oneself
-->

***

**Lab tests involving real charitable giving**

<!---
- Several on crowding out of 'government spending', others' gifts
\footnote{Andreoni (1993), Bolton and Katok (1998), Eckel, Grossman, and Johnston (2004) (in-group[?]), Crumpler and Grossman (2006) (out-group) [recheck these]}
-->

**Reinstein (2005/2012, mimeo): first direct investigation of...**

- Multiple sequential choices in same experiment, random-lottery-incentive
    - Mainly between-subject variation: estimate heterogeneous response, but with obvious contrasts


. . .


- Direct/indirect effects of treatments (choice sets, matches/price, information/promotion) on targeted/other charity

- Inferring "Expenditure substitution" of one gift for another (same or different category)



. . .


*Results:*

- All shocks increase giving to targeted charities; price-elastic

- Leads to decreased giving to non-targeted charities (+ cross-price), particular where these are similar
    - but typically less than 'complete crowding out'


<!---
\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/firstwave_means_ed.png}
\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/secondwave_Ameans_ed.png}
> All of the specific shocks strongly increase giving to the targeted charities,
> and this leads to decreased giving to the charities not targeted;
> I interpret this as a form of crowding-out. In standard economic terms,
> subjects exhibit price-elastic demand and positive cross-price elasticities between charities,
> particularly when the charities serve similar goals [Unicef \& Care]
> When subjects ... increase giving to one charity in periods where [it alone] is given to a positive treatment
> they generally decrease their total giving to the other charities and rarely increase it
- 33\% of subjects have a relatively 'fixed purse': total giving varying less than 25\% between stages
\footnote{Todo - Return to data: can we correlate this with particular demography and psych characteristics? Prior givers especially?}

2. Video-based campaign and "challenge" for one of the 3 charities
3. Repeat donation decision.
. . .
$\rightarrow$ Campaign for one charity "fully crowds out giving to the other charities without changing the total donations"
-->

**Other lab real-charity experiments**


- Harwell et al (2015, mimeo); design resembles Reinstein (2012), finds full crowding-out

- Ek (2017, JEBO): Real effort-based, 'exchange rates' vary by round, between-subject variation in charity paired with Unicef
    - Give a lower share to UNICEF when other charity is 'cheaper', slope steeper when paired with a similar charity (along 2 dimensions)

<!---
- Lab experiment, Swedish students, 42\% Business/Econ majors
- Real effort task, 'earnings' depend on effort, 5 rounds, RLI
    - In each round can allocate earnings among two charities - Unicef and something else (varied by treatment)
    - "Exchange rates" varied across stages
- Consider two dimensions of charity difference: Local/Global (geographical scope) and 'Cause dimension'
Between-subject variation in charity paired with UNICEF:
\includegraphics[height=0.9in]{picsfigs/ektreatments.png}
-->

<!---
*Design*
20 EUR (approx) show-up fee
- In each of 5 rounds (RLI) ...
1. Learn "exchange rates" for each charity (Unicef always about 1 Eur/point)
2. Can do "Slider Adjustment Task" for 120 seconds to earn points
3. Can allocate points earned among the 2 charities
    - Cannot *keep* the money (could only avoid doing sliders) (Why?)
- Exchange rates for non-Unicef charity randomly drawn in each stage, *without* replacement, from 4, 8, 10, 12, and 16
\footnote{In typical experiments, participants do about 27 sliders in 2 minutes.
Depending on the exchange rate, this should imply between about 10-40 Euros typically at stake?}
\footnote{Note they've a sixth round with exchange rate of 16 for both, but they don't discuss it much}
\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/sliderbars.png}
*Results*
\includegraphics[width=4.2in]{picsfigs/ek_effortresponse.png}
\footnote{Little or no response of *effort* to the exchange rates}
\includegraphics[height=3in]{picsfigs/ekpriceresponse.png}
\footnote{Give less (basically lower share, as earnings are similar) to UNICEF when other charity is 'cheaper'
And slope is steeper (confirmed in regressions) when paired with a similar charity;
much shallower when paired with charity that is dissimilar along other dimensions }
\footnote{Todo: Think about, look closer into whether this difference holds for people at the intensive margin (give to both).}

##Observational evidence

Reinstein, 2010, BEJEAP; PSID/COPPS data

- Many negative significant correlations between residuals from fixed-effects regressions
    - Esp. for larger (prior) donors and for certain paired cause categories
    - Plausible econometric assumptions $\rightarrow$ negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution
    - Interpretation: heterogeneous motivations for giving, small vs large givers

- Donations in a state affected by a tornado (causing 10+ injuries) increase by about 2\% in that year and in the 2 years after
- Argue: evidence against (complete) crowding out


***

Scharf ea. (15, WIP)

- Data from Charities Aid Foundation, 130,000 individual charity accounts, 2009-2014; covers 6 major disasters

- Increase in giving after disaster appeal, no reduced giving to international relief later on

- 'Fail to reject zero substitution' of all other charity, with 'precisely estimated' effects

- Time-shifting: Giving to *all* charities, even unrelated ones, increase in the 5 weeks after disaster, but decrease in weeks 6-13

###Donkers et al (2016, JBEE)

- Access to databases of 5 largest charities in NL

- Targeting 21,000 'extra mailings' to 9000 existing donors,  all sent in one week

<!---
(cf, donors to all 5 typically get 1 mailing every 2 weeks)
-->


<!---
Access to the databases of five large charity organizations in the Netherlands, containing names and addresses of their donors. This enables us to create a unique dataset of direct mailings and (possible) donations at the individual level. Two charities are concerned with the health sector, two charities with the international aid sector and one charity with the social welfare sector. Our dataset covers mailings and donations during more than three and a half years, from January 2004 until August 2007,
... e, we only select previous donators of each charity to receive experimental mailings of that charit
...
Each charity sends at most one experimental mailing to each individual in addition to the regular mailing campaigns that are scheduled throughout the year. The experimental mailings are extra mailings as compared to the charities’ regular mailing strategies and the charities agreed (after our consultation) not to adjust their mailing strategies in response to the experimental mail
...
… treatment conditions [vary]  the number of experimental mailings that subjects will receive. Each charity sends at most one experimental mailing to each individual in addition to the regular mailing campaigns that are scheduled throughout the year. The experimental mailings are extra mailings as compared to the charities’ regular mailing strategies… we selected a week in which no regular mailings were planned by the five charities.
... our field experiment consists of sending 21,000 mailings to a total of 9000 subjects.
...Control group, we select 12,000 subjects who will not receive additional mailings, consisting of 2400 subjects from each ‘number of active charities’ condition.
We have access to the databases of five large charity organizations in the Netherlands,  … [focus on ‘active’ donors]
… we need a model-based analysis that controls for the large heterogeneity in donating behavior across donors and across charities. In fact, economically meaningful effect sizes could easily be swamped by the amount of predictable variation that is present in our data.
-->

<!---
\includegraphics[height=2in]{picsfigs/donkers_mailings.png}
-->

***

**Results**

*Direct:* each experimental mailing generates 1.81 Euro (short run)

\bigskip

*Cannibalization, net:* ... lowers future revenues by 1.21 Euros, representing a 62% loss of the initial gain

\pdfnote{...the net revenues of 0.69 Euro is still statistically significant.}

\bigskip


. . .


*Competition*

- Extensive margin:  -0.36\% impact of a competitive mailing (cf predicted response rate of 13.39%)

- Combined margins: - EUR 0.10 per competitive mailing (cf 2.41 Euros baseline)
    - 10\% summed effect on all competitors

. . .


Long run (5 months):

- Extra mailing reduces total future donation EUR 1.51 (1.81-1.51=0.30)
- Competition not significant (but large se $\rightarrow$ little stat power)

<!---
\pdfnote{Cannibalization is estimated to be about 63\%, so mailings are profitable for the charity as long as the costs are lower than 37% of the revenues
  or about 0.90 Euro. Accounting for sector-level effects, there is an additional loss of 10% of the revenues through competitive effects.
 The costs of a mailing should there- fore not exceed 27\% of revenues, which is about 0.65 Euro.
[cf actual mailing cost of 0.51 Euro], charities can still send out more mailings to increase their own revenues,
 without harming the total amount of money available for the good causes that the charitable sector supports as a whole.}
-->

***

##Synthesis, limits of previous evidence

- Still mixed and limited evidence

. . .


- Donkers ea provides the most powerful and relevant evidence, imho
    - But limited to a particular set of donors to multiple causes, particular low-impact shock (extra mailing), to existing donors to all causes
    - Does not connect direct and indirect effects of mailings, nor report on 'how closeness of charities matters'


. . .


- Need for more evidence mapping substitution patterns:
    - What about the *charity* determines whether one charity crowds out or complements another?
    - ... and what about the *appeal* itself and the timing between the appeals?
    - ... and for whom (individual heterogeneity)?
    - ... over a longer term
    - ... for particularly relevant pairings (effectiveness and impact)


#Q3. Responses to charity-specific information


***

##Ratings in general

<!---
Who Gives to Effective Charities? What Makes Them Give? - Peter Hickman
-->

**Yörük (2016, JEMS)**

- Charity Navigator stars based on continuous score across categories (not EA criteria)

- Identification via RD: Impact of crossing a 'star' threshold on amounts raised

\bigskip

*Results:*  Significant impact for small charities only: finds a nearly 20\% effect of a one star increase

\bigskip

- CF Gordon ea (2009): rating *changes* associated with changes in contributions

- Cf Brown ea (2017, lab experiment): + effect of + Charity Navigator rating on selecting charity to 'work for'


<!---
- No significant overall effect (contradicts previous literature)
-->



<!---
- We have data on charity ratings (here, from 'Charity Navigator') and on amounts each charity raises per year (public reporting)
    - Does a regression of amounts raised on the rating tell us the *impact* of the rating?
    - No! Better charities may get higher ratings and more donations because of their *quality*, not because of the rating.
    - Response: Look at *changes* in ratings/donation (fixed effect modeling)
    - But: "time-variant unobservable charity characteristics that are correlated with charitable contributions may also be correlated with the third party ratings"
- But note that the 'Charity Navigator' gives discrete 'star ratings' based on a continuous score
    - Class: Any idea how this can help?
"Regression discontinuity": If we robustly control for the *score*, we can look at the effect of *crossing a star threshold*
- Being 'just above' or 'just below' a threshold can be seen as random
- But donors may react to the *stars* and not see the score itself; so crossing the threshold may have a large effect

-->

***

##Analytical information, the act of ranking and rating, overhead vs effectiveness

- Karlan and Wood (2017): adding scientific impact information

    - increased giving among large prior donors, reduced giving among small prior donors

    - little net effect


. . .


*Careful in encouraging evaluation:*

- it may switch off system-one

- enable self-justification for self-interest


***


##Avoiding information?

- People may avoid the ask (Dellavigna ea; Andreoni 'bell ringers)

- Avoid learning information that would induce them to give, use information to *reduce* giving?

. . .


Fong & Oberholzer-Gee, 2010, JPubE; lab charitable giving

> "Dictators [charitable giving] who acquire information mostly use it to withhold resources from less-preferred types, leading to a drastic decline in aggregate transfers";

... however, there are selection effects. The exogenous provision of information seems to increase donations overall.
- Strong 'overhead aversion' (bias) (Gneezy ea, '14, Science)

\pdfnote{Aversion to overhead runs counter to most outcome and impact-based economic models of giving \textCR
Gneezy ea find  most effective to use lead donor funds to "cover overhead"}

- "Evaluability bias": preference for effectiveness rel. to overhead (may) increase in *joint* evaluation (Caviola ea, '14; hypothetical choices)

\pdfnote{with joint evaluation, comparing attributes between options shifts preferences towards attributes which are harder to evaluate in separate evaluation modus, e.g. effectiveness vs. overhead}

***

##Presentation of impact and beneficiary information

**Individual beneficiary vs large group ('identifiable victims effect')**

- Claim: Better to portray an individual (child) than convey the total affected Small & Loewenstein (03); Small et al (07); Kogut and R (05)


. . .


**But**

- *Learning* about identifiable victims bias:

    - Small et al. (2007): learning (directly/indirectly) about this bias reduced emotional response and donations towards identifiable victims, didn't increase giving to statistical victims

    - and identifiable victim does *not* raise more with simultaneous choice (joint evaluation) \footnotesize{(Kogut and R '05)}

    -  Dual process): 'System 2' switches off empathy and giving?

- And mediated by social distance: Presenting charitable *organization* works better for more socially distant recipients \footnotesize{(Ein-Gar and L, '12; see also Kogut and R '07)}

***

**Sudhir ea (16)**, natural fundraising field experiment

\bigskip

\includegraphics[width=4in]{picsfigs/supportagran.png}

\bigskip

- Individual (vs unidentified group) framing (++)

- In-group (vs outgroup) (+)
\pdfnote{but identified out-group raises more than unidentified in-group}

- A 'loss' condition (+)


***

**Positive vs. negative framing; loss or gain terms?**

\bigskip

- Isen & Noonberg (1979) "poster" experiment, n-54. Dyck & Coldevin (1992) find negative images/messages reduce donations

- Several other papers find the opposite, or find this is mediated by congruency of image/message, and temporal framing (Chang ea, '09)


<!---
###Drivers of empathy (for outsiders)
-->


#What gets people to give to the most effective charities?

##

- Ultimately, we don't know, and we have very little evidence focusing on *choice* of charities and on *international/effective* giving

    - Marketing/advertising, psychology and economics literature needs to be better connected

***

**Future research should target (imho)**

- Who gives to the *truly* most effective international charities?

- Who is most likely to be convinced, and which arguments/presentations work in the SR and LR, and for whom (heterogeneity)?

    - Statistical learning-based analyses

- Practicable techniques in a range of higher-stakes real-world environments

- Replication (and verification), pooled evidence, meta-analysis

    - Context-sensitivity, large SE $\rightarrow$ large samples, statistical learning controls, sharing data

    - Responses to 'obvious contrasts' seem to not reflect between-subject responses
